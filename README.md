<h1>My ChatApp Firebase Project</h1>

ChatApp is an application that allows users to securely sign in with Google, join any desired chat room, and engage in real-time communication with other users. In this application, users join private chat rooms by entering the name of the chat room they choose. They can express themselves better by adding emojis to the messages they write here via the emoji-picker-react library. Users can quickly and securely sign in with their Google accounts using Firebase Authentication. Chats are updated instantly with the Firebase Realtime Database, and users can instantly forward their messages to other users. The application works responsively according to the screen sizes.
